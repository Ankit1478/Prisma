## Introduction to Prisma

Prisma is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool that provides a type-safe and database-agnostic way to interact with databases. It offers a powerful query builder and schema definition language.

## Getting Started

To get started with Prisma, follow these steps:

1. Install Prisma CLI globally: `npm install prisma -g`.
2. Initialize a new Prisma project: `prisma init`.
3. Define your data model in `schema.prisma`.
4. Run `prisma migrate dev` to create database migrations.
5. Use Prisma Client to interact with your database in your application code.

## Prisma Concepts

### 1. Data Model

The data model in Prisma is defined using the Prisma Schema Language. It describes the structure of your database tables, their relationships, and constraints.

Example:

```prisma
model User {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  name      String
  email     String   @unique
  posts     Post[]
}

model Post {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  content   String?
  author    User     @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId  Int
}
